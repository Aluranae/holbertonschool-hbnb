# AirBnB Clone Project
> A custom version of AirBnB

## Welcome to the HBNB project

This project is part of my curriculum at Holberton School. It is the third major group project, marking a new milestone in our journey as full-stack developers. Developed in close collaboration with two other students, its purpose is to design and build a complete web application that replicates the core functionalities of the AirBnB platform.

The project aims to provide users with an intuitive and secure interface to publish, search, and book accommodations. It is built following a layered architecture, combining front-end and back-end components, and adheres to rigorous technical and stylistic standards. This README details the requirements, structure, and implementation strategies that guided the development of our own AirBnB clone — codenamed HBNB.

# HBnB - UML

As a preliminary step before implementation, this subproject focuses on designing the core architecture of the HBnB application using UML (Unified Modeling Language). The objective is to plan, model, and document the main components of the system — including users, places, reviews, and amenities — through a set of standardized diagrams.

- The goal is to produce clear, structured documentation that will guide the development of the full application. This includes:
- A high-level package diagram to illustrate modular organization.
- A detailed class diagram representing the business logic layer.
- Sequence diagrams that map out key user interactions via the API.
- A final compilation of all these elements into a cohesive technical blueprint.

This modeling phase ensures consistency, modularity, and clarity before the actual coding begins, laying a strong foundation for the HBnB project.
