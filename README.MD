# AirBnB Clone Project
>

## Welcome to the HBNB project

This project is part of my curriculum at Holberton School. It is the third major group project, marking a new milestone in our journey as full-stack developers. Developed in close collaboration with two other students, its purpose is to design and build a complete web application that replicates the core functionalities of the AirBnB platform.

The project aims to provide users with an intuitive and secure interface to publish, search, and book accommodations. It is built following a layered architecture, combining front-end and back-end components, and adheres to rigorous technical and stylistic standards. This README details the requirements, structure, and implementation strategies that guided the development of our own AirBnB clone — codenamed HBNB.
